"""
OpenHands Agent SDK - Large File Surgical Condenser Example

This example demonstrates the use of `LargeFileSurgicalCondenser` to manage context window
bloat caused by large tool outputs, specifically images from the `FileEditorTool`.

The Surgical Condenser follows a "Post-Inference Cleanup" strategy:
1. Turn 1 (Action): Agent views a 1MB image. LLM sees the raw image data for analysis.
2. Turn 1 (Inference): Agent responds with its analysis.
3. Turn 2 (Start): Condenser detects that the image-heavy observation has been "processed"
   (followed by an agent response).
4. Turn 2 (Surgical Action): It replaces the raw image data with a concise summary string
   like "[Surgical Condensation] Viewed image/data" in the history.
5. Turn 2 (Inference): The conversation continues with a lean, summary-based history,
   keeping KV cache hit rates high.
